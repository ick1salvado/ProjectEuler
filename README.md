# ProjectEuler
My solutions to the Project Euler problems, with detailed descriptions on how the work.

## ***Please at least attempt the problems yourself before viewing the answers***

### What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is an archive dedicated to uploading series of computational problems that involve mathematics.
Each problem as stated in the description of the Project Euler page is always expected to run in less than a 
minute, meaning the the algorithm created should return the result in less than a minute but if it takes longer
that does not invalidate the answer and is a good starting point to refactor and make it more efficient. Each 
problem has a detailed description with a single input at the bottom to verify your answer. You can view these 
problems and read a more detailed description at the official [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) site.

### How is this Repository Formatted?
I organize each problem in folders containing various files:
- **Explanations File:** In this file I describe the solutions I have created in detail for each language I used.
- **Various Problem Files (Solutions):** These files will have the same name, but differ in the file extension where
the solution can be viewed in various programming languages.
- **ProblemDefinition:** This is where the exact problem is shown in the exact same manner that it would appear in 
Project Euler.
- **Math_Explanation File:** If I feel it necessary (or just interesting :) ), there will be a file that contains my 
mathematical definition for the solution of a problem with a description and mathematical expression. If in the 
Explanation File there is *(ME)* next to a part of the explanation it implies that I have added onto it in this file. 

Each of these Problem folders will be ordered in folders numbering by 10's (1-10, 11-20...).
I will try to add as many languages as I can.

#### P.S: 
I am by no means a good programmer **:)** and these solutions are most likely far less than optimal, but they
are a good starting point if to aid in the understanding of the problems or a basic set of logic to solve them.
Also feel free to comment on the discussions tab if you have any suggestions or questions.
