# ProjectEuler
My solutions to the Project Euler problems, with detailed descriptions on how the work.

## ***Please at least attempt the problems yourself before viewing the answers***

### What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is an archive dedicated to uploading series of computational problems that involve mathematics.
Each problem as stated in the description of the Project Euler page is always expected to run in less than a 
minute, meaning the the algorithm created should return the result in less than a minute but if it takes longer
that does not invalidate the answer and is a good starting point to refactor and make it more efficient. Each 
problem has a detailed description with a single input at the bottom to verify your answer.

#### P.S: 
I am by no means a good programmer **:)** and these solutions are most likely far less than optimal, but they
are a good starting point if to aid in the understanding of the problems or a basic set of logic to solve them.
