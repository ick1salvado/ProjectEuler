## C++ Solution:
  This solution simply consists of a single variable sum and a single
  for loop that counts up to the 1000 numbers requested, to find the 
  multples the modulus operator (%) is used, it returns the remainder
  of a division (if no remainder then it is a multiple), to sum decide
  whether or not a number is added.

## Python Solution:
  An array is created with the parameters being multiples of 3 and 5 
  and the sum (pre-defined list function in python) is printed directly.

## Java Solution:
  This solution is in essence the same as the C++ solution.
