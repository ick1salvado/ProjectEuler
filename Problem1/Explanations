C++ Solution:
  This solution simply consists of a single variable sum and a single
  for loop that counts up to the 1000 numbers requested, to find the 
  multples the modulus operator (%) is used, it returns the remainder
  of a division (if no remainder then it is a multiple), to sum decide
  whether or not a number is added.
